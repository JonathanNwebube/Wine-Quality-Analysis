# Wine Quality Analysis

A Machine Learning coursework project analysing the **Wine Quality dataset** using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.  
This project was completed as part of the **COMP1008 Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence** module (2024/25).

The notebook performs:
- Data inspection and cleaning  
- Missing value detection  
- Outlier and distribution analysis  
- Correlation analysis  
- Visualisation with Matplotlib  
- Linear Regression model  
- Secondary ML model (as required by the coursework)  
- Model evaluation and interpretation  

Only my own work is included. No lecturer-provided notebooks or restricted files are stored in this repository.
